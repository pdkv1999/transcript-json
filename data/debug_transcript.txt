Hello, thank you for coming in today.

00:00:07 Speaker 1

My goal is to understand your concerns for your child.

00:00:10 Speaker 1

What is your child's name and what age are they?

00:00:13 Speaker 2

My child's name is Mia and she is 10.

00:00:17 Speaker 1

Okay, what are you hoping to get out of this assessment process?

00:00:22 Speaker 2

I have noticed Mia has some challenges which I think may

00:00:30 Speaker 2

Lead me to think she may be autistic.

00:00:36 Speaker 1

What time does a child usually wake up?

00:00:38 Speaker 1

Do they need prompting to get up?

00:00:41 Speaker 2

No, my child wakes up early at about between 7 and 7.30am without prompting.

00:00:50 Speaker 1

Okay, is it a struggle for them to get out of bed?

00:00:53 Speaker 2

No, they like to be ultra prepared.

00:00:56 Speaker 1

How do they manage morning activities, getting dressed, brushing teeth, breakfast?

00:01:02 Speaker 1

Are they independent or do they need reminders?

00:01:05 Speaker 2

She's generally independent, she might need a reminder about something like brushing her teeth, but quite independent I would say.

00:01:13 Speaker 1

What parts of the routine, oh sorry, okay.

00:01:19 Speaker 1

What kinds of things do they need reminders for?

00:01:25 Speaker 2

Standout one is brushing teeth.

00:01:27 Speaker 2

Okay.

00:01:29 Speaker 2

Um, yeah.

00:01:31 Speaker 1

Do you know why?

00:01:35 Speaker 2

Um, she seems to forget it, but I also don't think she likes the process of brushing her teeth.

00:01:43 Speaker 1

What aspects of the process?

00:01:46 Speaker 2

She doesn't like toothpaste or the way it squirts out of the tube.

00:01:54 Speaker 2

Um,

00:01:55 Speaker 2

There's a couple of things that give her the ick.

00:02:02 Speaker 1

Okay.

00:02:02 Speaker 1

Do they eat breakfast?

00:02:04 Speaker 1

Who prepares it?

00:02:06 Speaker 2

She eats cereal every morning and generally she prepares it herself.

00:02:11 Speaker 1

How does she manage her school bag?

00:02:13 Speaker 1

Does she pack it to herself or does she often forget items?

00:02:17 Speaker 2

She packs it herself and it is extremely well organized.

00:02:22 Speaker 1

Okay, so they don't often, she doesn't often forget things.

00:02:26 Speaker 2

No.

00:02:27 Speaker 2

Right.

00:02:30 Speaker 1

How does she usually get to school?

00:02:32 Speaker 2

Just on the forgetting things for school, she can be anxious about thinking she might forget things.

00:02:41 Speaker 2

That's why she's packed by herself, really and really well organized.

00:02:47 Speaker 1

So, no, thank you.

00:02:50 Speaker 1

How does she usually get to school?

00:02:52 Speaker 2

I am by car.

00:02:54 Speaker 2

Generally I drive her.

00:02:55 Speaker 1

Is she normally on time?

00:02:58 Speaker 2

Yes.

00:02:59 Speaker 1

Right.

00:03:00 Speaker 1

You answered that emphatically.

00:03:02 Speaker 1

Is there something more to that?

00:03:05 Speaker 2

She puts pressure on me to get her there early.

00:03:08 Speaker 2

If she's late, it's my fault, not hers.

00:03:12 Speaker 1

I see.

00:03:14 Speaker 1

After school, what does her afternoon or evening look like in terms of lunch, homework, play activities?

00:03:25 Speaker 2

I collect her and her siblings from school.

00:03:32 Speaker 2

We come home, she'll have something small to eat and she'll immediately start homework.

00:03:39 Speaker 2

She can be tired after school.

00:03:42 Speaker 2

Her homework doesn't take her very long.

00:03:44 Speaker 2

She's quite bright and she generally likes to do her homework

00:03:50 Speaker 2

at the kitchen table and it's done quite quickly.

00:03:54 Speaker 2

And then she'll often go for a rest or do something quiet, but basically on her own.

00:04:03 Speaker 1

Does she need reminders to do the homework?

00:04:06 Speaker 2

No.

00:04:07 Speaker 1

She doesn't get distracted.

00:04:10 Speaker 2

She can...

00:04:13 Speaker 2

distracted?

00:04:16 Speaker 2

No, she can sometimes...

00:04:20 Speaker 2

go down a rabbit hole and get stuck in one thing and concerned that she doesn't understand it and sometimes if that happens it can take a long time with a bit of upset as well.

00:04:31 Speaker 2

But if that doesn't happen it goes quickly and is over quickly.

00:04:41 Speaker 1

Okay, how does she react when...

00:04:45 Speaker 1

do you ever intervene when she goes down a rabbit hole?

00:04:49 Speaker 2

Yeah, I do.

00:04:52 Speaker 2

I try and I know it can spiral into upset, so I try and intervene before we get to that point to come up with a reasonable explanation and try and divert her to something else.

00:05:09 Speaker 2

If she will have an issue, if she's not able to finish something and she would get quite anxious about

00:05:18 Speaker 2

going into school the following day, having something done incorrectly or unfinished.

00:05:24 Speaker 1

How does she react when you intervene?

00:05:40 Speaker 2

We manage it.

00:05:42 Speaker 2

Generally,

00:05:46 Speaker 2

She might initially resist, but I generally get around her so that we sort of dial down the anxiety before it spirals.

00:06:00 Speaker 1

Okay.

00:06:01 Speaker 1

After homework, what's her typical bedtime?

00:06:04 Speaker 1

Does she settle easily?

00:06:07 Speaker 2

Her typical bedtime is somewhere between 8:30 and 9, unless she's doing Karate.

00:06:15 Speaker 2

Might be a little bit later then.

00:06:17 Speaker 2

And yes, she settles quite easily.

00:06:22 Speaker 1

Does she use screens?

00:06:27 Speaker 2

Yeah, they...

00:06:29 Speaker 2

Yeah, she uses screens not immediately before bed.

00:06:40 Speaker 2

We have screen time on...

00:06:43 Speaker 2

her tablet so the amount of screen time she has is limited.

00:06:50 Speaker 1

How does she handle it when screen time is over?

00:06:56 Speaker 2

Okay actually because Niamh reads voraciously so she just turns around and picks up a book and just buries herself in that.

00:07:08 Speaker 1

What sort of content does she engage with on her screen?

00:07:15 Speaker 2

Um...

00:07:19 Speaker 2

Um...

00:07:19 Speaker 2

Minecraft...

00:07:22 Speaker 2

Um...

00:07:25 Speaker 2

That sort of thing.

00:07:26 Speaker 2

A lot of Minecraft.

00:07:29 Speaker 1

Does she play at a particular time of day?

00:07:32 Speaker 1

Does she play with other people?

00:07:34 Speaker 2

She plays with other people in school, although...

00:07:39 Speaker 1

Sorry, I mean Minecraft.

00:07:41 Speaker 2

Oh, sorry.

00:07:43 Speaker 2

Minecraft.

00:07:45 Speaker 2

I think she really plays with her siblings with Minecraft.

00:07:49 Speaker 2

You know, they're on a computer or whatever next to her.

00:07:54 Speaker 1

Okay.

00:07:55 Speaker 1

What class is Niamh in?

00:07:58 Speaker 2

Fourth class.

00:07:59 Speaker 1

How does she manage transitions between, that she comes across in school, like between teachers, classes, or schools?

00:08:08 Speaker 1

For example, moving up a class or having a substitute teacher.

00:08:13 Speaker 2

Niamh generally does not manage change very well.

00:08:15 Speaker 2

It has to be very well flagged in advance and she has to be prepared before the change happens.

00:08:26 Speaker 2

Otherwise, it won't go so smoothly.

00:08:29 Speaker 1

Can you give an example?

00:08:35 Speaker 2

An example is

00:08:40 Speaker 2

There was one year where she was moving from class A to the next class up.

00:08:48 Speaker 2

She was expecting, when she walked in that September, to have teacher X teaching her, but the classes had been reassigned and she had a teacher in front of her that she wasn't expecting at all.

00:09:09 Speaker 2

that she found very difficult to accept and make her peace with.

00:09:16 Speaker 1

You said she's bright and she does her homework quickly, so she's doing academically well.

00:09:22 Speaker 2

Yes, she is.

00:09:23 Speaker 1

She's ahead of the class average.

00:09:28 Speaker 2

Oh yeah, she is well ahead of class average, but she has had some challenges along the way.

00:09:36 Speaker 1

Have teachers raised any specific academic concerns?

00:09:44 Speaker 2

Only a number of years ago when approximately senior infant's first class time, she was behind in reading and needed resource help for six weeks after she came

00:10:04 Speaker 2

into school in September, we'd say from senior infants to first class.

00:10:09 Speaker 1

Was there any insight into why she needed a bit of extra help there?

00:10:16 Speaker 2

I think, and this is just my opinion, two things.

00:10:23 Speaker 2

She had completely and utterly forgotten what she had learned in senior infants at the beginning of first class, and also she

00:10:33 Speaker 2

Didn't like to and still doesn't.

00:10:37 Speaker 2

She doesn't like to ask for help in a, with a crowd.

00:10:44 Speaker 2

She prefers, she prefers, she doesn't find it comfortable asking for help or appearing, appearing behind or challenged in a crowd.

00:11:06 Speaker 2

Okay.

00:11:09 Speaker 2

So then she got some resource teaching for about half an hour a day, maybe not five days a week, for about six weeks, one-on-one.

00:11:20 Speaker 2

So she could ask in a safe space, she could ask for help with the teacher and that worked very well.

00:11:31 Speaker 1

Okay, so she needed some additional help there.

00:11:34 Speaker 1

Does she need anything like movement breaks?

00:11:39 Speaker 1

Anything to...

00:11:44 Speaker 2

There's nothing official in the school for Niamh, but the teacher that she has sort of plans certain things

00:12:00 Speaker 2

so that she does get a break if a particular lesson is going on for quite a long time.

00:12:10 Speaker 2

Niamh can, if something's going on for quite a long time, she can fall into a daydream and, you know, completely zone out of what's happening in the classroom.

00:12:21 Speaker 1

Do teachers raise concerns about attention, distractibility or behaviour?

00:12:31 Speaker 2

From time to time teachers have highlighted that she has issues.

00:12:41 Speaker 1

Attention distractibility or behaviour issues.

00:12:44 Speaker 2

With keeping attention they have highlighted that she can get distracted or she can fall into a daydream.

00:12:56 Speaker 2

Behaviour otherwise no.

00:13:01 Speaker 1

Does the teacher feel it impacts her learning?

00:13:11 Speaker 2

Maybe a little bit, but she's generally ahead of her peers so that's not a concern.

00:13:19 Speaker 1

Does she need frequent prompts from the teacher to stay on task or to do things like check your homework or keep up?

00:13:28 Speaker 2

Needs prompts from the teacher to come back from the daydream and come back to focus attention on what's happening in the classroom, yes.

00:13:40 Speaker 1

Does she struggle with handwriting, spelling or organisation of written work?

00:13:44 Speaker 2

Absolutely not.

00:13:48 Speaker 1

Does she use any assistive tools like laptops, visual schedules, sensory cushions?

00:13:53 Speaker 2

No.

00:13:55 Speaker 1

Are there specific subjects that she enjoys or dislikes?

00:14:06 Speaker 2

She's not hugely impressed with Irish, but apart from that, she seems to enjoy everything else.

00:14:11 Speaker 1

I see.

00:14:13 Speaker 1

How is she socially at school?

00:14:15 Speaker 1

Does she have friends?

00:14:16 Speaker 1

Does she get along with her peers?

00:14:18 Speaker 1

Does she have any bullying?

00:14:21 Speaker 2

She had a, her best friend,

00:14:27 Speaker 2

And since she was in preschool, that worked well.

00:14:32 Speaker 2

But that child has recently left the school and she's struggling at the moment.

00:14:43 Speaker 1

Okay.

00:14:43 Speaker 1

Does she have any difficulty focusing on tasks that take time?

00:14:53 Speaker 2

I couldn't say that she has.

00:14:56 Speaker 1

Does she seem easily distracted by noises or by what others are doing?

00:15:01 Speaker 2

Yes, she can often get distracted by noises or by somebody else chewing or sniffling or any of those sounds that might be coming from classmates adjacent to her.

00:15:22 Speaker 2

Yeah, all that bothers her.

00:15:25 Speaker 1

In the classroom, does the teacher say she is often looking out the window or out of the children?

00:15:31 Speaker 2

From time to time, teachers have said that, yeah.

00:15:36 Speaker 1

That's around the daydreaming thing you mentioned.

00:15:37 Speaker 2

Yeah.

00:15:40 Speaker 1

At home, what kind of things will pull her attention away from the task?

00:15:53 Speaker 2

I can't think of any particular example.

00:15:58 Speaker 2

Again, maybe some odd noises or whatever will affect her focus on a task.

00:16:06 Speaker 2

Like the Hoover going or you know, some other machine or whatever in the house.

00:16:13 Speaker 1

Does she tend to make careless mistakes in homework or classwork?

00:16:18 Speaker 2

No.

00:16:20 Speaker 1

Does she avoid or resist tasks that require sustained effort, like reading or writing?

00:16:28 Speaker 2

No, she, well, she reads as a hobby voraciously.

00:16:35 Speaker 2

Maybe she wouldn't read, be too enthusiastic about reading something that was assigned that she didn't find interesting.

00:16:45 Speaker 1

Does she fidget, move constantly or find it hard to stay seated?

00:16:49 Speaker 2

She does fidget.

00:16:53 Speaker 2

She moves in her chair and she does fidget, yes.

00:16:56 Speaker 1

In what situations is this most noticeable?

00:17:01 Speaker 1

Meal times, classroom, watching TV.

00:17:07 Speaker 2

Can't say about the classroom, but I expect it's happening there.

00:17:10 Speaker 2

I notice it in the old times.

00:17:12 Speaker 2

I notice it when she's sitting, doing anything really.

00:17:17 Speaker 2

You know, there'll be some repetitive movements or whatever going on.

00:17:23 Speaker 1

Can you tell me what do the repetitive movements look like?

00:17:28 Speaker 2

Swinging her leg, rocking in a chair, rocking back and forth a bit.

00:17:34 Speaker 2

Not, you know, mildly, but swinging out of something, that sort of thing.

00:17:42 Speaker 1

Does she talk excessively, interrupt or blurt out answers in class or at home?

00:17:48 Speaker 2

At home, I could say she does all three.

00:17:55 Speaker 1

Does she interrupt other children as well as adults?

00:17:59 Speaker 2

Yeah.

00:18:00 Speaker 2

Yeah, she can do.

00:18:01 Speaker 1

Does it seem like she can't wait for her turn to speak?

00:18:05 Speaker 2

Yeah, she needs to make, once the point occurs to her, it needs to get out there into the world as soon as possible.

00:18:16 Speaker 1

Okay.

00:18:18 Speaker 1

Does she seem to prefer a solitary play or grog play?

00:18:26 Speaker 2

I would say solitary, yeah.

00:18:32 Speaker 2

or maybe one or two, but she's not great in a large group.

00:18:39 Speaker 1

What do friendships look like for Niamh?

00:18:42 Speaker 1

Do they find it easy to make and keep friends?

00:18:48 Speaker 2

As I said, her best friend recently left the school and she has found that a loss and currently she is struggling to strike up friendships with

00:19:00 Speaker 2

her other classmates and so she does find it a challenge.

00:19:06 Speaker 1

So would you be able to say do friendships tend to last or do they have frequent fallouts?

00:19:14 Speaker 2

I don't think she has frequent fallouts.

00:19:19 Speaker 2

She struggles to establish a deep friendship in the first place.

00:19:25 Speaker 2

Or she is struggling right now I should say.

00:19:29 Speaker 1

How does she interpret common social cues like turn-taking in conversations, sarcasm, body language?

00:19:35 Speaker 2

I think she's...

00:19:36 Speaker 2

I'm sure she struggles with that.

00:19:39 Speaker 2

She certainly struggles to read other people's body language.

00:19:43 Speaker 2

Yeah.

00:19:46 Speaker 1

Okay.

00:19:50 Speaker 1

Does she have any strong interests or hobbies that she talks about a lot?

00:19:56 Speaker 2

She loves to read.

00:19:59 Speaker 2

And she reads voraciously.

00:20:03 Speaker 2

She likes Karate.

00:20:06 Speaker 2

I can't think of anything else right now.

00:20:18 Speaker 1

Is it difficult to steer the conversation to other topics?

00:20:22 Speaker 2

Yes, it can be.

00:20:25 Speaker 1

Does she show repetitive behaviours like lining things up, repeating actions, rocking, you mentioned fidgeting.

00:20:33 Speaker 2

Um, from time to time she has, you know, or I've noticed, um, uh, like she'd get focused or focused on, on doing something repetitively or doing something the same way all the time.

00:20:56 Speaker 2

Um, I try and break the cycle a bit.

00:21:00 Speaker 1

Okay.

00:21:01 Speaker 1

Are there sensitivities to sound, light, textures or crowded places?

00:21:06 Speaker 2

Textures, crowded places and sound.

00:21:13 Speaker 1

Okay, does Niamh worry a lot about school, friends or daily life?

00:21:21 Speaker 2

Yeah, I think she does worry.

00:21:24 Speaker 2

She certainly worries about friends and making friends at the moment.

00:21:29 Speaker 2

She is

00:21:36 Speaker 2

Yeah, she does worry and that causes her to try and be ultra prepared for things.

00:21:43 Speaker 2

And she doesn't like change.

00:21:44 Speaker 2

She worries if she doesn't have a solid picture of what's coming next.

00:21:54 Speaker 1

Does she avoid certain activities due to this worry?

00:22:02 Speaker 2

Yeah, I'd say, yeah, she would try to, yeah, from time to time.

00:22:08 Speaker 1

Can you give an example?

00:22:14 Speaker 2

I can't think of a specific example right now, but I know that if something new was coming along, she would try and she would be resistant to a new situation.

00:22:27 Speaker 2

unless I had it described very well beforehand and she had a very clear picture in her mind's eye of what it was going to look like.

00:22:37 Speaker 2

If there was any ambiguity, she would be resistant.

00:22:41 Speaker 1

Does she often seem sad, irritable or does she lose confidence in herself?

00:22:45 Speaker 2

I think she loses confidence in herself quite easily.

00:22:48 Speaker 1

Does she react to frustration or excuse me, how does she react to frustration, losing games or changes in routine?

00:22:55 Speaker 2

Changes in routine she

00:22:58 Speaker 2

struggles with.

00:23:01 Speaker 2

She can get upset if something isn't as she would have expected it to be in her mind's eye if it doesn't turn out that way or if something changes unexpectedly and she's not prepared.

00:23:18 Speaker 1

And on frustration and losing games.

00:23:22 Speaker 2

I think losing games can tend to knock her confidence a bit more than

00:23:28 Speaker 2

Your average child.

00:23:29 Speaker 1

And frustration, does she seem to struggle to calm down?

00:23:36 Speaker 2

Yeah, yeah, she needs a bit of help with that.

00:23:40 Speaker 1

Would you say she has meltdowns or tantrums?

00:23:44 Speaker 2

Yeah, I've used the word meltdowns several times.

00:23:47 Speaker 1

How often and how easily does she calm down?

00:23:54 Speaker 2

How often?

00:23:56 Speaker 2

Less frequently than before, but she might have a meltdown maybe, you know, depending on what's happening, but we'll say on average, maybe once a month, maybe a little bit more frequently than that.

00:24:14 Speaker 2

Generally, try and calm her down to a certain amount and then she'll go to her room and do something quietly until she calms herself down or soothes herself more.

00:24:26 Speaker 1

I'm going to ask some questions about sleep now.

00:24:30 Speaker 1

How long does it take her to fall asleep for when she gets into the bed?

00:24:38 Speaker 2

Not long, generally, unless she is sucked into a book.

00:24:45 Speaker 1

Does she often wake up at night having nightmares or restless sleep?

00:24:50 Speaker 1

Does she snore, grind her teeth or breathe heavily?

00:24:55 Speaker 2

No.

00:24:56 Speaker 1

Does she seem tired during the day?

00:24:59 Speaker 2

Tired at the end of the school day?

00:25:03 Speaker 1

Does she have a healthy appetite?

00:25:05 Speaker 2

Yes.

00:25:06 Speaker 1

Does she eat a wide variety of foods?

00:25:08 Speaker 2

She can reject some different foods.

00:25:17 Speaker 2

Maybe because of taste more than texture.

00:25:19 Speaker 2

Maybe because of texture more than taste, I mean.

00:25:22 Speaker 1

So she has some strong dislikes.

00:25:25 Speaker 1

What happens if a disliked food is on her plate?

00:25:28 Speaker 2

She won't eat it.

00:25:30 Speaker 1

And this is because of textures.

00:25:33 Speaker 2

More often, yeah.

00:25:35 Speaker 1

Is there a specific texture, like mushy or chewy?

00:25:38 Speaker 2

Mushy can be.

00:25:42 Speaker 2

Yeah, mushy, slimy, that sort of...

00:25:49 Speaker 1

Thank you.

00:25:50 Speaker 1

Does she avoid whole food groups?

00:25:55 Speaker 2

No.

00:25:56 Speaker 2

No.

00:25:57 Speaker 1

Does she have any concerns about, excuse me, are there any concerns about growth, weight or nutrition?

00:26:05 Speaker 2

Niamh[has a hormonal condition, redacted for stronger anonymity]and is getting treatment for that.

00:26:11 Speaker 2

Okay.

00:26:12 Speaker 2

There's a family history of that.

00:26:15 Speaker 1

Any sensitivities to clothing?

00:26:17 Speaker 2

Yes.

00:26:18 Speaker 1

Like tags, socks, fabrics.

00:26:21 Speaker 2

Tags and certain polyester type fluffy fabrics, yeah.

00:26:31 Speaker 1

Any difficulties in noisy, bright or crowded places?

00:26:37 Speaker 2

Yeah, bolstery.

00:26:41 Speaker 1

Any unusual motor habits like climbing excessively, hand movements, pacing, ticks?

00:26:49 Speaker 1

Or rocking.

00:26:50 Speaker 2

Imagined.

00:26:51 Speaker 2

Yeah, sort of, walking.

00:26:55 Speaker 2

Yeah, and fidgeting with her hands.

00:27:00 Speaker 1

Okay, some questions about pregnancy and early life.

00:27:04 Speaker 1

How many weeks was the pregnancy?

00:27:07 Speaker 2

Just over 38.

00:27:08 Speaker 1

What was her birth weight?

00:27:13 Speaker 2

Approximately?

00:27:14 Speaker 2

Approximately six and a half pounds.

00:27:18 Speaker 1

How was she born, vaginal or caesarean section?

00:27:20 Speaker 2

Caesarean section.

00:27:22 Speaker 1

Did she spend time in the NICU or the bedlord?

00:27:26 Speaker 1

No.

00:27:27 Speaker 1

How was the bonding and attachment, would you say?

00:27:29 Speaker 2

I would say it was good, yeah.

00:27:34 Speaker 1

How easy was it to feed her?

00:27:36 Speaker 2

Really easy.

00:27:37 Speaker 1

Breast or bottle?

00:27:38 Speaker 2

Breast.

00:27:39 Speaker 2

Breast initially, sorry.

00:27:42 Speaker 2

Breast initially, bottle after...

00:27:45 Speaker 2

Some, you know, introduce slowly after about 10 weeks plus or something like that.

00:27:50 Speaker 1

When you wanted to.

00:27:51 Speaker 2

Yeah.

00:27:52 Speaker 1

Sorry to be personal, but was there any postnatal depression or baby blues?

00:27:57 Speaker 2

No.

00:27:57 Speaker 2

No.

00:27:59 Speaker 1

Did they reach all milestones or were they delayed in any way?

00:28:09 Speaker 2

No, they reached everything.

00:28:11 Speaker 2

There was no concern about any of that.

00:28:14 Speaker 1

Were there many hospital visits or overnight stays in the first year of life?

00:28:17 Speaker 2

No.

00:28:21 Speaker 1

So these are now questions about risk factors, just screening for them.

00:28:27 Speaker 1

So I assume the child doesn't smoke, drink alcohol or vape?

00:28:31 Speaker 1

No.

00:28:32 Speaker 1

drug use?

00:28:33 Speaker 1

No.

00:28:33 Speaker 1

deliberate self-harm or suicidal thoughts?

00:28:36 Speaker 1

No.

00:28:36 Speaker 1

aggression leading to serious harm to others?

00:28:39 Speaker 1

No.

00:28:40 Speaker 1

hallucinations, voices or unusual beliefs.

00:28:42 Speaker 2

No.

00:28:43 Speaker 1

Thanks.

00:28:44 Speaker 1

How does your child get along with siblings and parents?

00:28:52 Speaker 2

I think parents, she gets along very well.

00:28:57 Speaker 2

Siblings, I think she gets along quite well with her siblings.

00:29:01 Speaker 2

I notice sometimes a closer relationship, that some of her sisters have a closer relationship with each other.

00:29:10 Speaker 2

She's, I think, a little bit more isolated than the others.

00:29:15 Speaker 2

in the sibling group.

00:29:17 Speaker 1

Are there frequent conflicts at home?

00:29:23 Speaker 1

No.

00:29:23 Speaker 1

Do you notice differences between her home and school behaviour?

00:29:31 Speaker 2

No, I don't.

00:29:34 Speaker 2

No, sorry, let me correct.

00:29:37 Speaker 2

I think her school, from what I understand, her school behaviour is pretty impeccable.

00:29:47 Speaker 2

She's not perfect but it's good.

00:29:50 Speaker 2

I think she can let her hair down and get a bit upset more easily here.

00:29:56 Speaker 2

I think she's doing a bit of holding it in in school.

00:30:00 Speaker 1

Does she participate in sports clubs or hobbies?

00:30:03 Speaker 2

Yes.

00:30:04 Speaker 1

Does she have any medical conditions, any surgeries or any medication that she takes regularly?

00:30:10 Speaker 2

She[receives/takes treatment for her hormonal condition]once daily.

00:30:18 Speaker 2

There's no other medication and she has not had any surgeries.

00:30:26 Speaker 1

Okay, how's her confidence and self-esteem?

00:30:29 Speaker 2

I would say it's not where I would like it to be, not as confident as I would like her to be.

00:30:43 Speaker 2

Yeah, she can be shaken.

00:30:44 Speaker 2

Easily enough.

00:30:45 Speaker 1

Is there a main area where the confidence is low?

00:30:54 Speaker 2

The first area I would say would be she's not confident about her social interactions and making friends.

00:31:04 Speaker 2

And the second area, which has no foundation, is she can easily, her confidence can be knocked about in

00:31:15 Speaker 2

about her academic ability.

00:31:18 Speaker 1

Thank you.
